Forked from https://github.com/joshnajera/godot-vim - many thanks to the original author and contributors, but it hasn't been maintained for over 8 months so decided to use this fork to get all the PRs merged.

### Override Default Godot Shortcuts with `godot-vim`'s ones

Note that all non-ascii character mappings that are already mapped in the default Godot editor have to be unmapped from the Editor settings (Editor >> Editor Settings >> Shorcuts) before being usable with `godot-vim`.

This currently goes for:

- `Ctrl+R`
- `Ctrl+U`
- `Ctrl+D`

See the full list of non-ascii shortucts that may already be mapped by Godot and thus wouldn't work in `godot-vim` before releasing them in Godot settings: https://github.com/joshnajera/godot-vim/blob/main/addons/godot-vim/godot-vim.gd#L135
